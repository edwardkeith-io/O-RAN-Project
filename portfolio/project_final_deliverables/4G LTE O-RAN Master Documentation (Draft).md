# <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">System and hardware requirements</mark>

There are two main parts of a mobile base-station â€“ the radio access network (RAN) and the mobile core network. These parts are typically bundled and sold as proprietary hardware and software. However, the advance in virtualization technologies and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware has made it possible to implement such a base station using open-source software and Software Defined Radios (SDR). 

These installation and operation steps specifically apply to the equipment used in our testbed. If the SDR module you are using is different, the driver steps may not be applicable. Please refer to the manufacturer's driver installation guide for your SDR.

# <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> Native Installation</mark>

## Stage 1: Install UHD drivers for the SDR

1. **Update and Install Required Packages**:
   This step ensures the system has all necessary libraries and tools for building UHD.

    ```bash
   sudo apt-get -y install autoconf automake build-essential ccache cmake cpufrequtils doxygen ethtool fort77 g++ gir1.2-gtk-3.0 git gobject-introspection gpsd gpsd-clients inetutils-tools libasound2-dev libboost-all-dev libcomedi-dev libcppunit-dev libfftw3-bin libfftw3-dev libfftw3-doc libfontconfig1-dev libgmp-dev libgps-dev libgsl-dev liblog4cpp5-dev libncurses5 libncurses5-dev libpulse-dev libqt5opengl5-dev libqwt-qt5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libtool libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev libusb-dev libxi-dev libxrender-dev libzmq3-dev libzmq5 ncurses-bin python3-cheetah python3-click python3-click-plugins python3-click-threading python3-dev python3-docutils python3-gi python3-gi-cairo python3-gps python3-lxml python3-mako python3-numpy python3-opengl python3-pyqt5 python3-requests python3-scipy python3-setuptools python3-six python3-sphinx python3-yaml python3-zmq python3-ruamel.yaml swig wget
   ```

2. **Create a Working Directory**:
   This step creates the necessary working directories and prepares the system for UHD installation.
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /root/workarea && cd /root/workarea
   ```

3. **Clone the UHD Repository**:
   Download the UHD repository from GitHub, specifically checking out version 4.7.0.0.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EttusResearch/uhd.git && \
   cd uhd && git checkout v4.7.0.0
   ```

4. **Build and Install UHD**:
   Now, move into the host directory, build the UHD host libraries, and run the tests.
   
   ```bash
   cd host && mkdir build && cd build && \
   cmake .. && make && make test
   ```

5. **Install UHD Libraries**:
   Finally, install the compiled UHD libraries and update the system library path.
   
   ```bash
   sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
   ```

6. **Configure Environment Variable**:
   Add the library path to the bash configuration file to ensure it's available for future sessions.
   
   ```bash
   echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

7. **Download UHD Firmware Images**:
   This step ensures the necessary UHD firmware is downloaded.
   
   ```bash
   sudo uhd_images_downloader
   ```

Did it work? 
- Yes - Continue to Native Installation, Stage 2
- No - Refer to troubleshooting part ?

## Stage 2: Test and Verify the Operation of the USRP

- Connect the USRP to the Host Computer

The included USB 3.0 cable provides power and data connectivity for the USRP Bus Series. The host-side of the cable must be plugged into either a USB 2.0 or 3.0 port. Note that a USB 2.0 link provides less bandwidth, and USB 3.0 is recommended. 

Once the software tools are installed on the host computer, verify the correct operation of the USRP by running the utility programs on the host computer.

Devices attached to your system can be discovered using the `uhd_find_devices` program. This program scans your system for supported devices and prints out an enumerated list of discovered devices and their addresses. The list of discovered devices can be narrowed down by specifying device address args.

```bash
uhd_find_devices
```

Device address arguments can be supplied to narrow the scope of the search.

```bash
uhd_find_devices --args="type=usrp1"

-- OR --

uhd_find_devices --args="serial=12345678"
```

Did it work? 
- Yes - Continue to Native Installation, Stage 3
- No - Refer to troubleshooting part ?

## Stage 3: Install srs-RAN software

1. **Install Dependencies for srsRAN**
    - Installs essential tools and libraries for compiling and running srsRAN.
    ```bash
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y 
        build-essential cmake libfftw3-dev libmbedtls-dev 
        libboost-program-options-dev libconfig++-dev libsctp-dev
    ```

2. **Add Software Radio Systems Repository**
    - Adds the SRS PPA for accessing the required packages.
    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:softwareradiosystems/srsran && apt-get update
    ```

3. **Install Additional Libraries for srsGUI**
    - Installs libraries required for the srsGUI interface.
    ```bash
    apt-get install -y 
        libboost-system-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev
        libqwt-qt5-dev qtbase5-dev
    ```

4. **Clone and Build srsGUI**
    - Clones the **srsGUI** repository and builds the graphical user interface.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/srsLTE/srsGUI.git && 
    cd srsGUI && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make
    ```

5. **Clone and Build srsRAN**
    - Clones the **srsRAN 4G** repository, builds the source, and installs it.
    ```bash
    cd /root && git clone https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN_4G.git && 
    cd srsRAN_4G && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make && sudo make install
    ```

6. **Install srsRAN Configuration Files**
    - Installs configuration files for both user and service mode.
    ```bash
    sudo ./srsran_install_configs.sh user && sudo ./srsran_install_configs.sh service
    ```

In the event that the above configuration install command fails, a srsUE example configuration file can be found [here](https://github.com/srsRAN/srsRAN_4G/blob/master/srsue/ue.conf.example)

Did it work? 
- Yes - Continue to Operation, Stage 1
- No - Refer to troubleshooting part ?

# <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Docker Installation</mark>

## How to install Docker on various operating systems

The srsRAN ecosystem relies upon access to a hardware radio unit (for example the B205-mini). Due to USB passthrough complications, we recommend running Docker on a native Linux install (ideally Ubuntu 22.04). If you wish to use a different virtual environment, please refer to the steps below. 

### Install and Configure Docker On Windows

You need to be running Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). This enables nested operating systems, in our case Ubuntu processes will run within Windows. This allows us to pass a USB device from Windows to WSL, which is necessary because Docker Desktop (which can run natively in Windows) does not fully support USB passthrough. Essentially we are using WSL to launch the docker container. 

#### Install Docker

1. Download Docker Desktop

- Visit https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install
- Download the latest Docker Desktop Installer executable
- Run the Installer
- Double-click `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`
- Ensure "Use WSL 2" option is selected during configuration
- Follow the installation wizard

2. Post-Installation Setup

- Restart your computer after installation completes
- After restart, Docker Desktop will start automatically
- Accept the Docker Subscription Service Agreement when prompted

3. If WSL 2 is required:

- Open PowerShell as administrator
- Run: `wsl --install`

4. Verify the installation:
- Open PowerShell
- Run: `docker run hello-world`

5. Optional Configuration:

- To configure Docker to start automatically with Windows:
  - Open Docker Desktop
  - Go to Settings
  - Enable "Start Docker Desktop when you log in"

Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any issues with user permissions, add your user account to the docker-users group:

```powershell
net localgroup docker-users <username> /add
```

#### Configure Docker for USB passthrough

1. Install the `usbipd-win` tool, which allows you to share USB devices with WSL 2:
	Download and install from: [https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases)

2. Identify your USB device:

- Open PowerShell as Administrator
- Run: `usbipd list`
- This will show you a list of USB devices with their bus IDs:

```powershell
	PS C:\Windows\system32> usbipd list
Connected:
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
1-2    2708:0009  USB Input Device, Audient iD4                                 Not shared
3-6    1050:0407  USB Input Device, Microsoft Usbccid Smartcard Reader (WUDF)   Not shared
3-11   0bda:0852  Realtek Bluetooth Adapter                                     Not shared
3-12   048d:5702  USB Input Device                                              Not shared
3-14   0c70:f00d  QUADRO, USB Input Device                                      Not shared
4-1    5241:00ac  USB Input Device                                              Not shared
6-4    046d:c547  LIGHTSPEED Receiver, USB Input Device                         Not shared
7-1    00de:0081  USB Input Device                                              Not shared
7-4    2500:0022  WestBridge                                                    Shared
```

3. Attach the USB device to WSL 2:

In the same PowerShell window, run this:

```powershell
usbipd attach --wsl --auto-attach --busid <busid>
```

- Replace `<busid>` with the ID of your USB device from Step 2. Usually you would need to reattach the USB device each time you restart your computer or disconnect/reconnect the device. Due to the way the UHD drivers handle the USB interface, we found this created issues. Therefore we amend the command to include the `--auto-attach` option.

- In your WSL 2 Linux distribution, the device should now be visible. You can check with:

```bash
ls /dev/bus/usb
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2500:0022 Ettus Research LLC USRP B205-mini
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
```

- You can see here that the Ettus B205-mini has been successfully passed from Windows to Ubuntu (WSL). It is on `Bus 001`, and is `Device 002`.
- You may have to specify the distribution in order for `usbipd` to work. In our case it looked like this:

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> wsl --list
Windows Subsystem for Linux Distributions:
docker-desktop-data (Default)
docker-desktop
Ubuntu-22.04
```

```powershell
PS C:\Windows\system32> usbipd attach --wsl Ubuntu-22.04 --auto-attach --busid 7-4
usbipd: info: Selecting a specific distribution is no longer required. Please file an issue if you believe that the default selection mechanism is not working for you.
usbipd: info: Using WSL distribution 'Ubuntu-22.04' to attach; the device will be available in all WSL 2 distributions.
usbipd: info: Using IP address 172.17.160.1 to reach the host.
usbipd: info: Starting endless attach loop; press Ctrl+C to quit.
WSL Attached
```

4. Now, when running your Docker container, you can pass the device from Ubuntu to Docker using the `--device` flag:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --privileged --device=/dev/bus/usb/001/002 srsdocker
```

- Replace `<bus>` and `<device>` with your appropriate numbers from Step 2. Also note the added `--privileged` modifier in order to avoid permissions errors.

### Install and Configure Docker On Mac

#### Interactive Install Method

- Download Docker Desktop from the official Docker website
- Double-click the downloaded Docker.dmg file
- Drag the Docker icon to your Applications folder1
Double-click Docker.app in the Applications folder to launch
Accept the Docker Subscription Service Agreement

### Install and Configure Docker On Linux 

This method does not require pre-Docker USB configuration, you only need to determine where the USRP is connected. 

1. Plug in the USRP. In your Linux terminal, the device should now be visible. You can check with:

```bash
ls /dev/bus/usb
```

2. When running your Docker container, you can pass the device through using the `--device` flag:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --device=/dev/bus/usb/<bus>/<device> ubuntu ls -l /dev/bus/usb/<bus>/<device>
```

- Replace `<bus>` and `<device>` with the appropriate numbers from Step 1.

3. This should start the container.

Did it work? 
- Yes - Continue to Docker Operation, Stage 1
- No - Refer to troubleshooting

You can see here that the B205-mini was visible in WSL, and then running the command `uhd_find_devices` kicked it from the environment. 

```bash
edward@EPC:/home$ sudo docker run -it --privileged --device=/dev/bus/usb/001/002 srsdocker
root@4413dbe0ad00:/# ls

When `uhd_find_devices` ran, Powershell showed a disconnection:

```powershell

```



# Docker Operation

How to run the docker container @elfadog needs to input here 


Once the Docker container is running, and you have a new terminal window to access it, refer to Operation Stage 1.

Please note that when issuing commands within the Docker container (as opposed to natively on a Linux test system), you can omit the `sudo` portion of the command. In order to correctly operate the USRP device, the Docker container must have admin privilege.
Make sure to check the commands are applicable to your launch environment, and amend the `sudo` inclusion if not.

## Ping

### Start srsEPC:

On the machine designated for the core network (Machine 1), start srsEPC by running in terminal:

```bash
srsepc
```
This will create a virtual network interface named srs_spgw_sgi with an IP address of 172.16.0.1.

### Start srsENB:

On the same machine (Machine 1), in a separate terminal, start srsENB by running:

```bash
srsenb
```

### Start srsUE:

On the second machine (Machine 2), run srsUE by executing:

```bash
srsue
```

This will create a virtual network interface named tun_srsue with an IP address in the 172.16.0.x range, such as 172.16.0.2. That IP address will be assigned to the UE device. 

### Ping Test:

To test connectivity, run a ping command from the UE to the EPC's IP address:

```bash
ping 172.16.0.1
```

If you want to test from the EPC to the UE, first find out the UE's assigned IP address (e.g., 172.16.0.2) and then run:

```bash
ping <ue_ip_address>
```

If you want to test constant connectivity, for example when monitoring range, then you can run an endless ping from the UE device:

```bash
ping -t 172.16.0.1
```

## Using RTL-SDR with SDR++ and Wireshark to test the connection:

@elfadog if you have any info on Wireshark it goes here 

[Open: SDR++ on 4G Band 7.png](document_assets/master_doc_assets/4G%20LTE%20O-RAN%20Master%20Documentation%20(Draft)/b04646cfa530aa066948971c79aae67c_MD5.jpeg)
![](document_assets/master_doc_assets/4G%20LTE%20O-RAN%20Master%20Documentation%20(Draft)/b04646cfa530aa066948971c79aae67c_MD5.jpeg)

## File Transfer:

### Step 1: Install OpenSSH Server
Install an OpenSSH server to accept incoming SSH and `scp` connections.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

### Step 2: Start the SSH Service
After installation, start and enable the SSH service to ensure itâ€™s running and set to start on boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

### Step 3: Check SSH Status
Verify that the SSH server is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

You should see `active (running)` if the SSH service is working properly.

### Step 4: Configure the Firewall
If you have a firewall enabled, allow SSH traffic through the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw reload
```

### Step 5: Determine the EPC/ENB Machineâ€™s IP Address
Check the IP address of the machine running `srsEPC` and `srsENB`:

```bash
ifconfig
```

Ensure this IP is accessible from the UE machine.
e.g. 172.16.0.1

### Step 6: Create a User Account (Optional)
If you prefer not to use the root account, create a new user for file transfers from srsepc device:

```bash
sudo adduser transferuser
sudo passwd transferuser
```

e.g. 

```bash
sudo adduser srsuser
sudo passwd srsuser
```

### Step 7: Perform the File Transfer via SCP
On the UE machine, use `scp` to transfer the file to the EPC/ENB machine:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/file transferuser@<EPC_IP>:/path/to/destination/
```

- Replace `<EPC_IP>` with the IP address of the EPC/ENB machine.
- Replace `/path/to/local/file` with the file you want to transfer.
- Replace `/path/to/destination/` with the directory on the EPC/ENB machine where you want the file to go.

e.g scp testfile.txt 172.16.0.1:/home/katnap/ttransfer/received 
or
scp /home/katnap/ttransfer/sent/testfile.txt 172.16.0.1:/home/katnap/ttransfer/received

### Step 8: Verify the File Transfer
After the transfer is complete, log into the EPC/ENB machine and check the destination directory to ensure the file was received:

```bash
ls /path/to/destination/
```

```bash
ls /home/katnap/ttransfer/received
```

### Examples:

Client end should look like this:

# <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Troubleshooting</mark>

## Native Installation Stage 1

*Insert*

## Native Installation Stage 2

If the USRP device does not show when running the `uhd_find_devices` command, try these additional troubleshooting steps.

Properties of devices attached to your system can be probed with the `uhd_usrp_probe` program. This program constructs an instance of the device and prints out its properties, such as detected daughterboards, frequency range, gain ranges, etc...

```bash
sudo uhd_usrp_probe --args=<device-specific-address-args>
```

**Naming a USRP Device**

For convenience purposes, users may assign a custom name to their USRP device once it is found. The USRP device can then be identified via name, rather than a difficult to remember serial or address. A name has the following properties:

- is composed of ASCII characters
- is 0-20 characters
- is not required to be unique

Run the following commands:

```bash
cd <install-path>/lib/uhd/utils
./usrp_burn_mb_eeprom --args=<optional device args> --values="name=lab1_xcvr"
```

**Discovery via name**

The keyword `name` can be used to narrow the scope of the search. Example with the find devices utility:

```bash
uhd_find_devices --args="name=lab1_xcvr"

-- OR --

uhd_find_devices --args="type=usrp1, name=lab1_xcvr"
