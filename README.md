# Executive Summary


Our project aims to emulate the implementation of an open-source 5G small cell base-station, leveraging Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and off-the-shelf hardware. The primary objective is to replicate the functionality described in the paper [T ARXIV.ORG: 2205.13178](research_paper.pdf), utilizing a standard laptop/PC and Ettus Laboratories [B-205-mini SDR](https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-b205mini-i/) (Software Defined Radios) module with appropriate antennas. Secondary objective is the production of detailed documentation on the process and troubleshooting, to aid in further replication and improve usability. 

-   Scope: The project scope encompasses the emulation of both RAN and mobile core network functionalities using open-source software and SDR technology. We will focus on developing software components that replicate the functions of proprietary hardware, ensuring compatibility with existing network infrastructures.

-   Time: The project is scheduled to commence immediately upon approval, with a duration of 12 weeks. Weekly progress meetings will be held to track milestones and address any challenges encountered during the development process.

-   Method: We will adopt the Security-oriented Software Development Life Cycle (SecSDLC) methodology, emphasising security-oriented practices throughout the development lifecycle. This approach ensures that security considerations are integrated from the initial planning stages to the final deployment phase.

-   Risks: Potential risks associated with hardware handling, software compatibility issues, and SDR integration have been identified. Mitigation strategies include proactive risk management measures, regular communication with stakeholders, and contingency planning to address unforeseen challenges.

## Context for the Project:

5G small cell (pico) base-stations can provide advanced features and standalone capabilities for private networks. There are two main parts of a mobile base-station â€“ the radio access network (RAN) and the mobile core network. These parts are typically bundled and sold as proprietary hardware and software. However, the advance in virtualization technologies and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware has made it possible to implement such a base station using opensource software and Software Defined Radios (SDR).

### Introduction to Client Organization:

The client for this project is **Auckland University of Technology**. The primary contact is Prof. Edmund Lai, who is serving as the touchpoint for client interaction.

### Problem, Need, or Opportunity:

Although the technology described by the [O-RAN Alliance](https://www.o-ran.org/) specifications has been defined and implemented successfully within research and development environments, there does not seem to be straightforward and exhaustive documentation on the technical deployment of a network following the O-RAN architecture.

All existing published research appears to be written for the purpose of dissemination within academic circles, assuming a highly specialised technical knowledge of its reader. We propose that the creation of a freely available and comprehensible record of the implementation of a 5G testbed following O-RAN standards will allow other researchers to access and replicate our project, laying the foundation for further groundwork for flexible, interoperable, and non-proprietary mobile networks.

In addition, we believe that the synthesis of such documentation will allow for easier circulation of the O-RAN architecture and its highly promising applications within amateur or hobbyist communities who might otherwise feel intimidated by a perceived high barrier of entry into this subject matter.

## Project Rationale

The need for this project stems from several key factors within the telecommunications industry, as well as emerging trends in wireless technology and infrastructure.

### Cost Effectiveness:

Traditional 5G small cell base-stations rely heavily on proprietary hardware and software solutions, resulting in high deployment and maintenance costs for network operators. By developing an open-source emulation solution, the project aims to significantly reduce these costs, making 5G infrastructure more accessible and affordable for a wider range of organizations.

### Scalability and Flexibility:

Proprietary solutions often lack the scalability and flexibility required to adapt to evolving network requirements. The open-source emulation approach allows for greater customization and adaptability, enabling network operators to tailor their infrastructure to specific needs and scale operations more efficiently.

### Compatibility and Interoperability:

Existing proprietary systems may face compatibility issues with other network components or protocols, limiting interoperability and hindering seamless integration within larger network ecosystems. The open-source emulation solution aims to address these compatibility challenges by providing standardized interfaces and protocols, enhancing interoperability and facilitating smoother integration with existing network infrastructure.

### Innovation and Collaboration:

Open-source projects foster innovation and collaboration within the industry, enabling developers and researchers to contribute to the advancement of 5G technology collectively. By embracing an open-source approach, the project encourages collaboration among industry stakeholders, driving innovation and accelerating the development of next-generation telecommunications solutions.

### Addressing Market Demand:

There is a growing demand for cost-effective and flexible 5G infrastructure solutions, particularly in sectors such as smart cities, IoT (Internet of Things), and industrial automation. The project aims to capitalize on this market demand by offering an open-source emulation solution that meets the needs of diverse industry verticals, opening new opportunities for deployment and expansion.

### Overcoming Vendor Lock-In:

Vendor lock-in is a common challenge faced by network operators, limiting their ability to switch providers or upgrade equipment without significant cost and disruption. The open-source emulation solution provides an alternative to vendor lock-in, empowering network operators to retain control over their infrastructure and reduce dependency on single vendors.

The project addresses critical issues within the telecommunications industry by offering a cost-effective, scalable, and interoperable solution for implementing 5G small cell base-stations. By embracing open-source principles and fostering collaboration, the project aims to drive innovation, address market demand, and overcome barriers to adoption, ultimately enabling a more accessible and efficient 5G infrastructure landscape.
